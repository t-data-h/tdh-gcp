TDH-GCP 
=========

A Framework for building GCP compute instances and deploying TDH.

The compute instances are managed by a set of scripts for building the master 
and worker node instances. Ansible is used for installing or updating/upgrading 
the TDH cluster.

### Instance initialization scripts:

- tdh-gcp-compute.sh:
  
  This is the base script for creating a new GCP Compute Instance. It Will 
create an instance and optionally attach data disks to the instance. It is 
used by the master and worker init script for creating the custom instances.

- tdh-masters-init.sh:
  
  Wraps *tdh-gcp-copmpute.sh* with defaults for initializing master hosts.
This will bootstrap master hosts with mysqld and ansible as we use ansible
from the master host(s) to manage and deploy the cluster. The first master 
is considered as the primary management node where Ansible is run from.

- tdh-workers-init.sh:  
  
  Builds TDH worker nodes in GCP similarly to the masters init, but generally 
 of a different machine type.


### Support scripts:

- tdh-gcp-format.sh: 
  
  Script for formatting and mounting a new data drive for a given instance.

- tdh-mysql-install.sh: 
  
  Bootstraps a Mysql 5.7 Server for an instance.

- tdh-prereqs.sh:
  
  Installs host prerequisites that may be needed prior to ansible bootstrapping.

- gcp-push.sh

   For pushing a directory of assets to a GCP host. The script will automatically 
   archive a directory, ensuring the directory to be archived remains as the root
   directory, that links are honored properly to create a tarball to be transferred
   to a given GCP host. The environment variable GCP_PUSH_HOST is honored as the 
   default host target. In the context of TDH, this script is used to push updates, 
   such as this repository, TDH Manager (tdh-mgr), and cluster configs from 'tdh-config'.
   ```
   $ export GCP_PUSH_HOST="tdh-m01"
   $ ./bin/gcp-push.sh .
     => result: gcloud compute scp tdh-gcp.tar.gz tdh-m01:tmp/dist/
   $ ./bin/gcp-push.sh ../tdh-mgr
     => result: gcloud compute scp tdh-mgr.tar.gz tdh-m01:tmp/dist/
   $ ./bin/gcp-push.sh ../tdh-config/gcpwest1 tdh-conf
     => result: gcloud compute scp tdh-conf.tar.gz tdh-m01:tmp/dist/
   ```
  The script also uses a common distribution path for moving about binaries. By default 
  this is *~/tmp/dist*, but can be provided by setting GCP_DIST_PATH.


### Examples:

Create three master nodes, first with a test run:
```
./bin/tdh-masters-init.sh -t 'n1-standard-4' test m01 m02 m03
./bin/tdh-masters-init.sh -t 'n1-standard-4' run m01 m02 m03
```

Create four worker nodes, with 256G boot drive as SSD.
```
./bin/tdh-workers-init.sh -b 256GB -S run d01 d02 d03 d04
```

## GCP Machine-Types:

### Very Small
- Master/Util   :  n1-standard-4  :  4 vCPU and 15 Gb 
- Worker/Data   :  n1-highmem-8   :  8 vCPU and 52 Gb  

### Smallish
- Master/Util   :  n1-standard-4  :  4 vCPU and 15 Gb
- Worker/Data   :  n1-highmem-16  :  16 vCPU and 104 Gb

 
Changing Machine Type:
```
$ gcloud compute instances set-machine-type tdh-d01 --machine-type n1-highmem-16
$ gcloud compute instances set-machine-type tdh-d02 --machine-type n1-highmem-16
$ gcloud compute instances set-machine-type tdh-d03 --machine-type n1-highmem-16
```
